# Avoiding Common Attacks

## Logic Bugs

Used truffle's automated testing framework to make sure the logic of my contracts behaved as expected

Followed coding standards and best practices

Avoid complex rules and implementation and tried to keep things as simple as possible

## Integer Arithmetic Overflow

Ensured that none of my variables in my contract stood a risk for this

## Poisen Data

Used require() to make sure only valid data was sent to the contract
